# Future Enhancements

This document covers foreseeable improvements and revisions that can be made to this service.
Below is the current list:

* Use Spring Data Rest to expose the Employee Resource
* Use external data source, instead of an in-memory.
* Use external User store for authentication, instead of in-memory.
* Improve validation messages returned due to ```@NotNull``` annotation. For example, refer to response for _Update Employee with Null Value_ 
request in the Postman request suite.
